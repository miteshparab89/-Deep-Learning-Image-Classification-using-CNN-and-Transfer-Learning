### Deep Learning Image Classification using CNN and Transfer Learning
## Project Description

This project focuses on building two deep learning models for image classification:

A Custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built from scratch
A Transfer Learning Model using pre-trained architectures
The objective is to preprocess image data, train both models, compare their performance, and analyze the impact of techniques such as Early Stopping and Learning Rate Reduction.

## Dataset

The project uses the CIFAR-10 dataset, containing:
60,000 color images (32×32 pixels)
10 classes with 6,000 images per class
Dataset link: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

## Data Preprocessing

Loaded and standardized CIFAR-10 data
Resized & normalized images to scale pixel values to [0, 1]
Applied data augmentation (rotation, flipping, zooming, shifting)
Visualized sample images and class labels
Objective: Ensure consistent image size, reduce overfitting, and improve generalization.

## Model Architecture
🔹 Custom CNN Model

Multiple Convolutional + MaxPooling layers
ReLU activations
Fully connected dense layers
Softmax output layer for classification

🔹 Transfer Learning Models

Fine-tuned pre-trained ImageNet models such as VGG16, ResNet50, or InceptionV3
Frozen base layers + new custom classifier on top
Faster training and improved accuracy with limited data

## Model Training
Custom CNN

Models were evaluated using multiple metrics:

Accuracy: Overall classification accuracy
Precision: Ratio of true positives to all positive predictions
Recall: Ratio of true positives to all actual positives
F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
Confusion Matrix: Detailed class-wise performance analysis

Transfer Learning

Fine-tuning selected pre-trained models
Early Stopping applied
Learning Rate Reduction (LRR):
Monitors validation accuracy
Patience: 4 epochs
Reduces LR by factor when performance stalls
Minimum LR set to prevent model collapse

## Model Evaluation

Models were evaluated using multiple metrics:

Accuracy: Overall classification accuracy
Precision: Ratio of true positives to all positive predictions
Recall: Ratio of true positives to all actual positives
F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
Confusion Matrix: Detailed class-wise performance analysis

 ## Transfer Learning Summary

Implemented several pre-trained models (e.g., VGG16, ResNet, Inception)
Fine-tuned for CIFAR-10 classification

Observations:

Transfer Learning models achieved higher accuracy
Faster convergence due to pre-learned features
More robust for small datasets

## Results & Discussion

Custom CNN:

Good performance but required longer training
More prone to overfitting without callbacks

Transfer Learning:

Outperformed CNN in accuracy and speed
Benefited significantly from LR Reduction
More stable training with fewer epochs

Conclusion:
Transfer Learning offers substantial advantages for image classification tasks, especially when computational resources or data are limited.

## Code Quality

Modular, well-structured, and thoroughly commented code
Clear separation of preprocessing, modeling, training, and evaluation phases
Easy for others to follow and reproduce results
